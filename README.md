## Support Latest macOS/Linux/Windows Dev Environments

This tool is for **educational purposes**, focusing on safely removing development-related junk files (Xcode, Flutter, Visual Studio, npm, etc.) to free up disk space.

---

### ✨ Features

* **One-Click Cleanup:** Clear Xcode, Flutter, Visual Studio, Gradle, npm, NuGet, IDE, and browser caches.
* **Comprehensive Flutter Cleanup:** Recursively finds and cleans all Flutter projects, removing:
  * Project-local FVM cache (`.fvm`)
  * Flutter build artifacts (`build`, `.dart_tool`, `.packages`)
  * Android Gradle caches (`android/.gradle`, `android/build`, `android/app/build`)
  * iOS CocoaPods caches (`ios/Pods`, `ios/.symlinks`, Flutter frameworks)
  * Global Flutter cache
  * Source-controlled files (`pubspec.lock`, `ios/Podfile.lock`, `.fvmrc`) are **never** touched
* **Interactive Menu:** Allows selection of specific cleanup targets (e.g., Xcode only).
* **Multi-platform Support:** Supports **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows**.

### 👀 How to Use

#### ⭐ Auto Run Script

**Linux/macOS**

To download, grant permission, and run the utility in one line:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snappymob/dev-cleaner/main/dev-cleaner.sh -o dev-cleanup.sh && chmod +x dev-cleanup.sh && ./dev-cleanup.sh
```

##### Command-Line Options

```powershell
# Show help
.\dev-cleaner.ps1 -Help

# Show version
.\dev-cleaner.ps1 -Version

# Custom Flutter projects directory
.\dev-cleaner.ps1 -FlutterDir "C:\Projects\Flutter"

# Custom Visual Studio projects directory
.\dev-cleaner.ps1 -VsDir "C:\Projects\DotNet"

# Both custom directories
.\dev-cleaner.ps1 -FlutterDir "D:\Flutter" -VsDir "D:\VisualStudio"
```

##### Environment Variables

```powershell
# Set in your PowerShell profile for persistence
$env:FLUTTER_SEARCH_DIR = "C:\Projects\Flutter"
$env:VS_SEARCH_DIR = "C:\Projects\DotNet"
```

##### Windows-Specific Cleanup

The Windows version includes all cross-platform cleanups plus:

- **Visual Studio:** Cleans `bin/`, `obj/`, `.vs/` folders from all .NET projects, plus global VS caches (ComponentModelCache, MEFCacheData)
- **NuGet:** Clears global packages cache (`~/.nuget/packages`), HTTP cache, and temp files
- **Windows Temp:** Clears user and system temp folders, plus Recycle Bin

> **Note:** Some operations require Administrator privileges. The script will automatically request elevation if needed.

#### 🧹 Flutter Cleanup Details

The Flutter cleanup option (Option 4) performs a comprehensive recursive cleanup of all Flutter projects starting from the current directory. It:

- **Recursively searches** for all `pubspec.yaml` files
- **Removes the project-local FVM cache** (`.fvm`; the global FVM SDK store and `.fvmrc` are left alone)
- **Cleans build artifacts**: `build/`, `.dart_tool/`, `.packages` (lockfiles are never deleted)
- **Removes Android Gradle** caches from each project
- **Removes iOS CocoaPods** caches and Flutter frameworks
- **Cleans global Flutter cache**

**💡 Pro Tip:** If you have active projects you work on daily, consider running the cleanup from a specific subdirectory (e.g., `~/old_projects` or `~/research`) rather than your entire development folder. This avoids unnecessary rebuilds of dependencies for active projects.

**Expected Space Savings:** Users have reported freeing up 50-100GB+ of disk space after running Flutter cleanup on multiple projects.

## Common Issues

### Permission Errors
- If you encounter permission errors while running scripts, try running with `sudo` (Linux/macOS) or as Administrator (Windows).

### Tool Not Found
- Make sure tools like `flutter` or `brew` are installed and added to your system PATH.
- On macOS/Linux, check PATH with `echo $PATH`.
- On Windows, check Environment Variables in System Settings.
